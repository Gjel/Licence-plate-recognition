# Instructions:
To run the program, run the main. The main is located in the
m_files directory.
 
When you run the main three windows will pop up: 
- All analyzed frames 
- All the potential hits
- A table with the final results

To run your own test files, edit the paths at the top of the
main.

We hope our work is satisfactory.
